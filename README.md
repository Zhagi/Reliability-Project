## ‚ùì The Problem

We were tasked to work for a veterinary hospital client's HOSP system where we were asked to:
* Preserve the functionality of the system
* Increase the reliability of the system and ensure no security breaches
* Implement some improvements to the system

## Constraints and Access
* **We only had access to the Load Balancer**
* We could submit tickets to HOSP or Corporate IT


## üéØ Our Reliability Target

* The system responds to 99% of user requests successfully
* Ensure no security breaches

## Getting Visibility 

* Set up an S3 bucket to get logs from the Load Balancer
* Use Athena on AWS to query the logs

## Findings

* Saw the we had a fair amount of 5XX status codes
* Varying response times from 2 to 20 seconds

## Improving the Reliability of the System

### 1. Retry Mechanism

![Reverse Proxy Diagram](images/reverse_proxy_server.png)

Using a retry mechanism would allow for 5XX status codes to be go through the HOSP server up to a certain number of time, rather than just once.

This would increase the success rate of requests and improve the reliability of the system.

#### Set Up 
* Created Nginx Web Server on an EC2 Instance
* Set up a Reverse Proxy on the Nginx server
    * Allowed failed requests to retry up to 5 times
    * 3 seconds interval between each retry
